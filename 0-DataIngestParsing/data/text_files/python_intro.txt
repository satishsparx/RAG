### **Introduction to Python**

Python is a **high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language** known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It was created by **Guido van Rossum** and released in **1991**.

### **Key Features of Python**

1. **Easy to Learn & Readable**

   * Syntax is similar to English, making it beginner-friendly.

2. **Interpreted Language**

   * No need to compile code; it runs line by line using the Python interpreter.

3. **Dynamically Typed**

   * You don’t need to declare variable types explicitly.

   ```python
   x = 10   # Integer
   x = "Hello"  # Now a string (no type declaration required)
   ```

4. **Cross-Platform**

   * Works on Windows, macOS, Linux, and more.

5. **Extensive Standard Library**

   * Provides built-in modules for file handling, math, networking, etc.

6. **Supports Multiple Paradigms**

   * Procedural, Object-Oriented, and Functional programming.

### **Basic Python Example**

```python
# Hello World Program
print("Hello, World!")

# Variables
name = "Alice"
age = 25
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")

# Simple Function
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Bob"))
```

### **Where is Python Used?**

* Web Development (e.g., Django, Flask)
* Data Science & Machine Learning (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn)
* Automation & Scripting
* Game Development
* IoT (Internet of Things)
* Cybersecurity & Networking
* Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Would you like me to create a **beginner-friendly Python learning roadmap** (syntax → data types → loops → OOP → projects) or a **crash course with examples**? Or both?
